You are analyzing a Go codebase for PyServer, a Python code execution sandbox server. The code implements session management and code execution with safety features. Here's the key context:

Project Overview:
- Purpose: Run Python code in isolated sessions with safety constraints
- Core Features: Session management, code execution, timeout handling
- Language: Go, interfacing with Python

Key Requirements:
1. Resource Management:
   - 5-minute session lifetime
   - 2-second execution timeout per code block
   - Separate stdout/stderr capture

2. Session Handling:
   - UUID-based session identification
   - Concurrent session support with mutex protection
   - State preservation between executions
   - Interactive Python interpreter per session

3. Safety Features:
   - Execution timeout protection
   - Proper process and resource cleanup
   - Error handling for process operations

Code Structure:
The implementation consists of two main types:
1. Session: Represents a Python interpreter instance
2. SessionManager: Handles session lifecycle and concurrent access

Key Implementation Details:
1. Process Management:
   - Uses os/exec to manage Python processes
   - Maintains stdin/stdout/stderr pipes
   - Handles process creation and cleanup

2. Code Execution:
   - Uses markers (__END__) to track execution completion
   - Implements timeout using context
   - Handles output parsing to remove Python prompts
   - Uses goroutines for concurrent output handling

3. Error Handling:
   - Session expiration
   - Execution timeouts
   - Process and pipe creation failures

Test Coverage:
The tests verify:
- Basic session creation and retrieval
- Code execution with various inputs
- Error conditions and timeout handling
- State preservation between executions
- Multi-line code execution
- Output parsing and cleanup

The code follows Go best practices for:
- Concurrent access protection
- Resource management
- Error handling
- Testing

Please analyze this code and provide insights on:
1. Implementation correctness
2. Potential improvements
3. Security considerations
4. Performance implications
5. Error handling completeness
